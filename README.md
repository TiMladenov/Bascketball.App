# Bascketball Application
v1.0 Udacity Practice Set 2 - Bascketball score keeper

# Description
This is the first data entry / interactive application from the course's Lesson 3 practice set - Making an App Interactive. The course taught me how to interconnect the XML UI widgets with their respective Java classes and catch user interactions and thus add functionality to the application.
